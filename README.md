Kalman Filter Notebooks

This repository contains simple notebooks containing examples of Kalman Filters implemented in Python using Numpy, Pandas and MatplotLib. They were developed as an exercise in learning more about how Kalman Filters can be applied in my engineering work (battery state estimation, SOC, SOH). Please feel free to download, use and tweak to your own needs.

I found the following resources useful when I was learning:
- [Kalman Filter Python -> Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0gai93yhsM)
- [Kalman Filter & EKF (Cyrill Stachniss)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6paM_Iwfc&t=3287s)
- [Battery Management Systems, Volume II: Equivalent-Circuit Methods](https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Management-Systems-Equivalent-Circuit-Methods/dp/1630810274/ref=pd_bxgy_img_sccl_1/143-8660073-0582100?pd_rd_w=9poSe&content-id=amzn1.sym.7757a8b5-874e-4a67-9d85-54ed32f01737&pf_rd_p=7757a8b5-874e-4a67-9d85-54ed32f01737&pf_rd_r=ZZ1NT4ZJ6TSXMW59YWXK&pd_rd_wg=0x3Fc&pd_rd_r=e5fa06c7-a67f-4d83-8eb3-244323ee1a1e&pd_rd_i=1630810274&psc=1)
  -  The chapters around developing state estimation derive all the equations for KF/EKF/SigmaPoint which is very helpful in understanding the implementaion
